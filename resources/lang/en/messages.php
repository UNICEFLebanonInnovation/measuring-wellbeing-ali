			As part of our focused psychosocial support program, we are conducting an assessment using an international tool comprised of 25 questions.
			Therefore, the way questions are asked remains the same and cannot be changed.
			The assessment aims to evaluate our programmes and whether they are contributing towards improving how children feel after attending these activities.
			The questionnaire would need an average of 20 to 30 minutes to be answered.
			You/your child have been randomly selected for this purpose.
			There is no compensation for responding nor is there any known risk.
			Your response will be used to help us improve our activities so we can better support children.
			You responses will remain confidential and anonymous at all stages as data will be compiled with a code.
			If you choose to participate in this project, please answer all questions as honestly as possible there is no right or wrong answer, and the more honest you are the better we can make our programs for children. Participation is voluntary and you can stop us at any moment.",
